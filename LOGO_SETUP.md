# Logo Setup Instructions

## Add Your Logo to the Project

1. **Save your logo image** as `vfix-logo.png` in the `/public` folder:
   ```
   /Users/pinara/Desktop/v-fix-demo/public/vfix-logo.png
   ```

2. **Image requirements:**
   - Name: `vfix-logo.png`
   - Location: `/public` folder (root of public directory)
   - Recommended size: 200x200px or larger
   - Format: PNG with transparent background (or any image format)

3. **After adding the logo:**
   - Commit and push to GitHub:
     ```bash
     git add public/vfix-logo.png
     git add src/components/Login.jsx
     git add src/components/Login.css
     git commit -m "Update logo and brand colors"
     git push origin main
     ```

4. **AWS Amplify will automatically rebuild** your app with the new logo and colors!
